# Quantum Clustering (K-means) Repository

## Overview
This repository hosts an implementation of Quantum Clustering using the K-means algorithm, a quantum-inspired approach to clustering data points. Quantum clustering leverages principles from quantum computing to efficiently partition data into clusters, offering potential advantages over classical clustering algorithms in certain scenarios. This project provides an implementation of the Quantum K-means algorithm along with tutorials and examples to demonstrate its usage and effectiveness in clustering datasets.

## Features
- **Quantum K-means Algorithm:** Implementations of the Quantum K-means algorithm using quantum computing concepts.
- **Tutorial Notebooks:** Jupyter notebooks providing step-by-step tutorials on how to use the Quantum K-means algorithm for clustering tasks.
- **Example Datasets:** Sample datasets for experimentation and demonstration purposes.
- **Performance Comparison:** Comparison with classical K-means and other clustering algorithms to evaluate performance and effectiveness.


## Contributing
Contributions to this project are welcome. If you're interested in improving the implementations, adding new features, or providing additional examples, feel free to fork the repository and submit a pull request.
